title:  "About Me"
---

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic university studying engineering with a specialization in autonomous control systems.

I've completed an internship at Dory Technology in which I set up data pipelines and ETL procedures, as well as developed auto-reporting scripts to track key business metrics. I'm also a part of the 2020 PolyU Singaporean Autonomous Underwater Robotics team where I developed computer vision systems for a mini-submarine to autonomously navigate an obstacle course.

My main languages are: Python, JavaScript (Node.js), and a bit of SQL; if you want a detailed overview, you can take a look at [my resume here][resume]. I posted some projects up on my [GitHub][gh] if you want to check them out as well :)

A bit more about me personally, I am born Indonesian but was raised in Hong Kong since I was three and have been living quite peacefully on the remote Lantau Island. Besides tech, I enjoy cooking, photography, and playing piano.
