Hello! I'm an undergraduate student at PolyU. I am interested in software development having done data engineering, data analytics and general back-end development in the past. I am also reading into statistics and machine learning to get more involved with data science as well.


Take a look at my latest projects:  
[Analyzing Facebook Chat Data][fb-data] // Done
